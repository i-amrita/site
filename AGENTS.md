## Commands

- `mise install` — pin Node 24, pnpm 12, intl-ai from `mise.toml`
- `pnpm install` — install deps (lockfile committed)
- `pnpm dev` — Astro dev on http://localhost:4321
- `pnpm build` — `astro build && pagefind --site dist`
- `pnpm preview` — serve `dist/` locally on :4322
- `pnpm check` — `astro check && tsc --noEmit`
- `pnpm lint` — `oxlint .`
- `pnpm format` — `oxfmt --write .`
- `pnpm format:check` — `oxfmt --check .`
- `pnpm test:e2e` — Playwright via `playwright-cli` skill
- `pnpm deploy` — `wrangler deploy` (after `pnpm build`)
- `pnpm intl-ai:fill` — translate missing keys in `ms.json` / `hi.json` / `de.json` / `ml.json`
- `pnpm intl-ai:check` — CI gate for missing/stale translations

## Hard rules

- **No `npm`/`npx`.** Use `pnpm` and `pnpm dlx`. Misuse the package manager and the build breaks.
- **No global Verdaccio config.** All registry config lives in this repo's `.npmrc`.
- **No global env mutations.** Tool versions pinned via `mise.toml`, never `nvm install`.
- **All UI state lives in the URL.** Use `nuqs` for React islands, `Astro.url.searchParams` for routes. Every visible state must be reachable as a static URL.
- **Every content page has a `.md` companion.** The same content source feeds HTML + `.md` + `llms-full.txt`.
- **No real LLM for search.** Pagefind + transformers.js MiniLM-L6-v2 + RRF, all in the browser. See `.agents/docs/search.md`.
- **No hand-edited `llms.txt`.** Generated at build time from content collections.
- **Use `oxlint`/`oxfmt`.** Never ESLint or Prettier.
- **Source Available, not OSS.** License is PolyForm Noncommercial 1.0.0. Don't add MIT/Apache headers to new files except where required (keycap CSS attribution, see NOTICE).
- **`keythm` keycap CSS recipe and sound are lifted.** Apache-2.0 attribution in NOTICE. The key sound sprite is a trimmed derivative of their `sound.ogg` (explicit owner override of the old "don't lift their sound" rule); never ship the full recording.
- **Gitflow.** Default branch = `develop`. Feature branches off `develop`. Release branches merge to `main`.

## Layout

```
src/
  pages/         # file = route. Each content page has a sibling .md.ts endpoint.
  components/
    astro/       # static, no JS
    react/       # interactive islands (.tsx)
  content/       # Astro content collections (projects, posts, now, about)
  i18n/          # Paraglide + intl-ai source
  lib/           # shared logic (audio, search, url-state, theme)
  styles/        # tokens.css + global.css

public/          # static assets, sounds, fonts, OG images
content/         # NOT USED — content lives under src/content/ (Astro convention)

.agents/
  docs/          # agent-facing deep dives (architecture, build, search, audio, llms, url-state)
  skills/        # progressive-disclosure skills
  screens/       # ASCII layouts (user flows, key maps)
  plans/         # gitignored — active planning

docs/            # public, generic docs (mirrors .agents/docs/architecture.md, no personal info)
```

- touching build pipeline → `.agents/docs/build.md`
- changing search → `.agents/docs/search.md`
- touching click/audio → `.agents/docs/audio.md`
- touching CmdK → `.agents/docs/cmdK.md`
- touching agent-facing URLs → `.agents/docs/llms.md`
- touching URL state binding → `.agents/docs/url-state.md`
- changing architecture → `.agents/docs/architecture.md` (and `docs/architecture.md`)
- adding a new skill → `.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`
- planning a non-trivial change → `.agents/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.md`

## Don't

- Don't add Pages Functions or SSR routes. Static-only.
- Don't add Google Fonts CDN. Self-host WOFF2 via `@fontsource/*`.
- Don't add a CMS. Content collections + MDX are the source of truth.
- Don't add analytics until launch decision is explicit.
- Don't hand-edit generated files (`llms.txt`, `llms-full.txt`, `dist/`).
- Don't commit `.env`, `.env.local`, secrets, or tokens.
- Don't push directly to `main`. PR from feature branch.
